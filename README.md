# String_Token
Java String Token

Given a string, s , matching the regular expression [A-Za-z !,?._'@]+, split the string into tokens. We define a token to be one or more consecutive English alphabetic letters. Then, print the number of tokens, followed by each token on a new line.

Note: You may find the String.split method helpful in completing this challenge.

 The string (s) is composed of any of the following: English alphabetic letters, blank spaces, exclamation points (!), commas (,), question marks (?), periods (.), underscores (_), apostrophes ('), and at symbols (@).
